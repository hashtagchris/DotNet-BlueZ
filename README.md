# DotNet-BlueZ
A quick and dirty library for BlueZ's D-Bus APIs. Primary focus is Bluetooth Low Energy.

[![DotNetBlueZ NuGet Badge](https://buildstats.info/nuget/DotnetBlueZ?dWidth=70&includePreReleases=true)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DotnetBlueZ/)

Uses [Tmds.DBus](https://github.com/tmds/Tmds.DBus) to access D-Bus. Tmds.DBus.Tool was used to generate the D-Bus object interfaces. D-Bus is the preferred interface for Bluetooth in userspace. The [Doing Bluetooth Low Energy on Linux](https://elinux.org/images/3/32/Doing_Bluetooth_Low_Energy_on_Linux.pdf) presentation says "Use D-Bus API (documentation in [doc/]((https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/bluetooth/bluez.git/tree/doc))) whenever possible".

# Requirements

* Linux
* A recent release of BlueZ. This package was tested with BlueZ 5.50. You can check which version you're using with `bluetoothd -v`.

# Installation

```bash
dotnet add package DotnetBlueZ
```

# Events

C# events are available for several properties. Events are useful for properly handling disconnects and reconnects.

# Usage

## Get a Bluetooth adapter

```C#
using DotnetBlueZ;
...

IAdapter1 adapter = (await BlueZManager.GetAdaptersAsync()).FirstOrDefault();
```

or get a particular adapter:

```C#
IAdapter1 adapter = await BlueZManager.GetAdapterAsync(adapterName: "hci0");
```

## Scan for Bluetooth devices

```C#
adapter.DeviceFound += adapter_DeviceFoundAsync;

await adapter.StartDiscoveryAsync();
...
await adapter.StopDiscoveryAsync();
```

## Get Devices

`adapter.DeviceFound` (above) will be called immediately for existing devices, and as new devices show up during scanning; `eventArgs.IsStateChange` can be used to distinguish between existing and new devices. Alternatively you can can use `GetDevicesAsync`:

```C#
IReadOnlyList<Device> devices = await adapter.GetDevicesAsync();
```

## Connect to a Device

```C#
device.Connected += device_ConnectedAsync;
device.Disconnected += device_DisconnectedAsync;
device.ServicesResolved += device_ServicesResolvedAsync;

await device.ConnectAsync();
```

Alternatively you can wait for "Connected" and "ServicesResolved" to equal true:

```C#
TimeSpan timeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(15);

await device.ConnectAsync();
await device.WaitForPropertyValueAsync("Connected", value: true, timeout);
await device.WaitForPropertyValueAsync("ServicesResolved", value: true, timeout);

```

## Retrieve a GATT Service and Characteristic

Prerequisite: You must be connected to a device and services must be resolved. You may need to pair with the device in order to use some services.

Example using GATT Device Information Service UUIDs.

```C#
string serviceUUID = "0000180a-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb";
string characteristicUUID = "00002a24-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb";

IGattService1 service = await device.GetServiceAsync(serviceUUID);
IGattCharacteristic1 characteristic = await service.GetCharacteristicAsync(characteristicUUID);
```

## Read a GATT Characteristic value

```C#
byte[] value = await characteristic.ReadValueAsync(timeout);

string modelName = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(value);
```

## Subscribe to GATT Characteristic Notifications

```C#
characteristic.Value += characteristic_Value;
...

private static async Task characteristic_Value(GattCharacteristic characteristic, GattCharacteristicValueEventArgs e)
{
  try
  {
    Console.WriteLine($"Characteristic value (hex): {BitConverter.ToString(e.Value)}");

    Console.WriteLine($"Characteristic value (UTF-8): \"{Encoding.UTF8.GetString(e.Value)}\"");
  }
  catch (Exception ex)
  {
    Console.Error.WriteLine(ex);
  }
}

```

# Tips

It may be necessary to pair with a device for a GATT service to be visible or for reading GATT characteristics to work. To pair, one option is to run `bluetoothctl` (or `sudo bluetoothctl`)
and then run `default agent` and `agent on` within `bluetoothctl`. Watch `bluetoothctl` for pairing requests.
